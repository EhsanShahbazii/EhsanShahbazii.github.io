## Hi:wave:
	
  This is my first simple front-end project in github:relaxed:. I made this project to practice **HTML**, **CSS** & a little **JavaScript**:rocket:.<br>
but it isn't responsive yet:sleepy:. After a while, i will start make responsive this site & turn **CSS** to **SASS**:muscle:.

  Back to project:smile:! I used **AOS**:fire:**library** to animate components & **fontawesome** icons.<br>
**I have inspired this site from another site:sweat_smile:. I tried to build it.**
<br>
